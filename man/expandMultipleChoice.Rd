\title{Function to expand response to a more than one answer multiple choice

\usage{
expandMultipleChoice(df, x, values, pattern = "", prefix = x,
  labels = values, sep = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the vector data that requires expansion.}

\item{x}{Name of variable in \code{df} containing vector needing expansion.}

\item{values}{Vector of string values used to create concatenated string
response.}

\item{pattern}{Pattern used to separate values in the concatenated string.
Default is "" for concatenated strings with no separator.}

\item{prefix}{Prefix to names of newly created variables.}

\item{labels}{Vector of names to use for columns of resulting data.frame.
If not specified, columns are named using \code{values}.}

\item{sep}{Charater to separate \code{prefix} from \code{labels} in the
names of newly created variables.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with same rows as \code{df} containing columns
  corresponding to each newly created variable.
